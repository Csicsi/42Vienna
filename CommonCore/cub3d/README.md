🎮 Cub3D – A Raycasting-Based 3D Game

Cub3D is a 42 Vienna project inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, using raycasting to create a pseudo-3D world in a 2D environment. It features animated textures, doors, wall collision detection, and smooth player movement with mouse-based turning, making for an immersive experience.

This was a duo project, where we divided responsibilities as follows:
🛠 My Contributions:

✅ Raycasting Engine – Implementing core 3D rendering via raycasting.
✅ Movement & Collision Handling – Smooth navigation with wall & door collisions.
✅ Animated Textures – Rendering GIF-like wall animations dynamically.
✅ Doors (Bonus Feature) – Interactive openable/closable doors.
✅ Mouse-Based Turning (Bonus Feature) – Allows smooth camera movement.
✅ Minimap – Real-time top-down player tracking.
👩‍💻 My Partner’s Contributions:

✅ Parsing System – Reading the .cub configuration file.
✅ Map Validation – Ensuring proper map structure and boundaries.
⚡ Features

    ✅ Real-time Raycasting – 3D projection using a 2D map.
    ✅ Animated Wall Textures (Bonus) – "GIF-like" wall animations.
    ✅ Interactive Doors (Bonus) – Openable/closable doors in the game world.
    ✅ Smooth Player Movement – Includes wall & door collision detection.
    ✅ Mouse-Based Camera Control (Bonus) – Look around smoothly with the mouse.
    ✅ Minimap – Displays the map layout with real-time player tracking.
    ✅ Configurable Maps – Loads from .cub files with custom textures & doors.
    ✅ Error Handling & Map Validation – Ensures correctness of .cub files.

📌 Raycasting (My Contribution)
🔹 How Raycasting Works

    Casts rays from the player’s position to detect walls.
    Uses DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Algorithm for fast wall intersection detection.
    Corrects fisheye distortion for realistic depth perception.
    Applies texturing to walls based on ray collision points.

🔹 Optimizations

    Uses distance correction to improve depth accuracy.
    Implements direction-based shading for realistic lighting.

📌 Animated Wall Textures (My Contribution)
🔹 How It Works

    Instead of static textures, walls use "GIF-like" animations.
    Uses a frame system that cycles through multiple images over time.
    Performance-optimized: Texture updates occur independently from rendering cycles.

🔹 Why This Matters

✅ Adds visual dynamism to environments.
✅ Supports looping animations for water, fire, or other dynamic elements.
✅ More immersive gameplay compared to static walls.
📌 Doors & Collision Handling (My Contribution)
🔹 Doors

    Doors are interactive – players can open & close them.
    Implemented using special map values (D for doors).
    Raycasting detects whether a door is open or closed, adjusting rendering accordingly.

🔹 Collision Handling

    Walls & Doors prevent movement – players cannot walk through them.
    Uses hitbox-based detection instead of single-pixel collision.
    Smooth edge handling ensures that the player doesn't get stuck.

📌 Mouse-Based Camera Control (My Contribution)
🔹 How It Works

    The mouse controls the player's field of view dynamically.
    Horizontal mouse movement rotates the camera smoothly.
    Acceleration is adjusted for precise control.

🔹 Benefits

✅ More intuitive than keyboard-only turning.
✅ Allows for quicker reactions & smoother gameplay.
✅ Feels closer to modern FPS controls.
📌 Movement & Minimap (My Contribution)

    Implements WASD movement with smooth interpolation.
    Uses arrow keys OR the mouse to rotate the player’s view.
    Minimap dynamically updates, displaying:
    ✅ Player position
    ✅ Walls, doors, and empty spaces
    ✅ Directional view indicator

📌 Parsing & Map Validation (Partner’s Contribution)
🔹 Parsing System

    Reads the .cub map file and extracts:
        Map layout
        Player start position
        Wall textures & door locations

🔹 Map Validation

    Ensures the map is:
        Surrounded by walls (no open spaces).
        Contains exactly one player start position.
        Has valid texture paths and color definitions.
