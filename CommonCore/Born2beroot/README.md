🏴‍☠️ Born2beroot – Secure Linux Server Configuration

Born2beroot is a system administration project at 42 Vienna that teaches students how to set up, configure, and secure a Linux server. The goal is to create a virtualized server, manage user roles, enforce security policies, and ensure system monitoring.
Key Topics Covered

    🏗 Virtual Machine Setup – Configuring a Debian-based or CentOS virtual machine.
    🔑 User & Group Management – Implementing sudo rules, groups, and secure authentication.
    🔒 Security Hardening –
        Configuring UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall).
        Setting up SSH with key-based authentication.
        Enforcing strong password policies using pam.d.
        Restricting root access for security.
    🛠 Service & Process Management –
        Setting up and configuring cron jobs.
    📊 System Monitoring – Implementing a custom monitoring script that logs essential system metrics.

Bonus Features

🔹 Configuring LVM (Logical Volume Manager) for dynamic disk management.
🔹 Automated system monitoring script that logs system uptime, CPU usage, RAM, disk usage, and active users.
🔹 Email notifications for system alerts and security warnings.
🔹 Advanced network security settings using additional firewall rules and SSH configuration.
