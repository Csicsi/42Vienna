# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Born2beroot ‚Äì Secure Linux Server Configuration

**Born2beroot** is a system administration project at **42 Vienna** that teaches students how to set up, configure, and secure a Linux server. The goal is to create a virtualized server, manage user roles, enforce security policies, and ensure system monitoring.

## Key Topics Covered

* Virtual Machine Setup ‚Äì Configuring a Debian-based or CentOS virtual machine.
* User & Group Management ‚Äì Implementing sudo rules, groups, and secure authentication.
* Security Hardening ‚Äì
* Configuring UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall).
* Setting up SSH with key-based authentication.
* Enforcing strong password policies using pam.d.
* Restricting root access for security.
* Service & Process Management ‚Äì
* Setting up and configuring cron jobs.
* System Monitoring ‚Äì Implementing a custom monitoring script that logs essential system metrics.

## Bonus Features

* Configuring LVM (Logical Volume Manager) for dynamic disk management.
* Automated system monitoring script that logs system uptime, CPU usage, RAM, disk usage, and active users.
* Email notifications for system alerts and security warnings.
* Advanced network security settings using additional firewall rules and SSH configuration.

## What I Learned

* How to harden a Linux system against attacks.
* Managing user roles and permissions with sudo and visudo.
* Automating maintenance tasks with cron jobs.
* Ensuring system security with SSH key authentication and fail2ban.
* Understanding virtualization using VirtualBox or UFW for firewall management.
* Using LVM to manage disk space dynamically (Bonus).
