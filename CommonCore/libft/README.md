📚 Libft – Custom C Standard Library

Libft is the first major project at 42 Vienna, where students recreate standard C library functions from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of memory management, pointers, and algorithms. This library serves as a foundation for future projects, allowing for custom implementations of essential functions.
Key Features

    * Reimplementation of libc functions (e.g., strlen, strcpy, atoi, strdup, memcpy)
    * Custom memory management (calloc, bzero, realloc)
    * Linked list utilities (ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_back, ft_lstiter)
    * String manipulation (ft_split, ft_strjoin, ft_strtrim)
    * Bonus functions for additional flexibility

Why Libft Matters

Libft is not just an exercise—it's a core utility that can be used in later 42 projects like Minishell, Philosophers, and Cub3D, making development more efficient.
