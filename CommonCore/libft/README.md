ðŸ“š Libft â€“ Custom C Standard Library

Libft is the first major project at 42 Vienna, where students recreate standard C library functions from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of memory management, pointers, and algorithms. This library serves as a foundation for future projects, allowing for custom implementations of essential functions.
Key Features

    âœ… Reimplementation of libc functions (e.g., strlen, strcpy, atoi, strdup, memcpy)
    âœ… Custom memory management (calloc, bzero, realloc)
    âœ… Linked list utilities (ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_back, ft_lstiter)
    âœ… String manipulation (ft_split, ft_strjoin, ft_strtrim)
    âœ… Bonus functions for additional flexibility

Why Libft Matters

Libft is not just an exerciseâ€”it's a core utility that can be used in later 42 projects like Minishell, Philosophers, and Cub3D, making development more efficient.
